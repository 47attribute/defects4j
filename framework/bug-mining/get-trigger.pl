=head1 NAME

get-trigger.pl -- Determines triggering tests for all reviewed version pairs in
F<work_dir/$TAB_REV_PAIRS>, or a single version (or range) specified by version_id.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

get-trigger.pl -p project_id  -w work_dir [ -v version_id]

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-p C<project_id>>

The id of the project for which the version pairs are analyzed.

=item B<-w C<work_dir>>

Use C<work_dir> as the working directory.

=item B<-v C<version_id>>

Only analyze this version id or interval of version ids (optional).
The version_id has to have the format B<(\d+)(:(\d+))?> -- if an interval is
provided, the interval boundaries are included in the analysis.
Per default all version ids are considered.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Runs the following workflow for the project C<project_id> -- the results are
written to F<work_dir/TAB_TRIGGER>.

For all B<reviewed> version pairs in F<work_dir/$TAB_REV_PAIRS>:

=over 4

=item 1) Checkout fixed version

=item 2) Compile src and test

=item 3) Run tests and verify that all tests pass

=item

=item 4) Checkout fixed version

=item 5) Apply src patch (fixed -> buggy)

=item 6) Compile src and test

=item 7) Run tests and verify that:

=over 8

=item No test class fails

=item At least on test method fails (all failing test methods are
    B<individual triggering tests>)

=back

=item

=item 8) Run every triggering test in isolation on the fixed version and verify that it passes

=item 9) Run every triggering test in isolation on the buggy verision and verify that it fails

=item 10) Export triggering tests to F<C<work_dir>/"project_id"/trigger_tests>

=back

The result for each individual step is stored in F<work_dir/$TAB_TRIGGER>.

For each step the output table contains a column, indicating the result of the
the step or '-' if the step was not applicable.

If the C<version_id> is provided in addition to the C<project_id>, then only
this C<version_id> is considered for the project.
