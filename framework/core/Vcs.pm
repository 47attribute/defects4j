=head1 NAME

Vcs.pm -- Provides a simple abstraction for version control systems

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 Example using Vcs::Svn:

use Vcs::Svn;

my $vcs = Vcs::Svn->new("project", "repo_url", "commit_db_file", \&_co_hook);

$vcs->checkout_vid("1b", "/tmp/1b");

sub _co_hook {
    my ($vcs, $revision_id, $work_dir) = @_;

    # do some post processing
}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a simple abstraction for version control systems.

=pod

A vcs object has to be instantiated with:

- Project name

- Repository url

- File name of the commit database (commit-db), see below for details

- Reference to post-checkout hook (optional) -- if provided, this method is called after each checkout.

The commit database has to be a csv file with the structure C<version_id,rev_1,rev_2>.

=over 4

=item B<lookup> C<lookup(vid)>

Queries the commit database (commit-db) and returns the C<revision_id> for
the given version id C<vid>. The format of C<vid> is B<\d+[bf]>.

=cut
sub lookup {
    @_ == 2 or die $ARG_ERROR;

=pod

=item B<num_revision_pairs> C<num_revision_pairs()>

Returns the number of revision pairs in the C<commit-db>.

=cut
sub num_revision_pairs {
    my $self = shift;
    return scalar keys %{$self->{_cache}};
}

=pod

=item B<get_version_ids> C<get_version_ids()>

Returns an array of all version ids in the C<commit-db>.

=cut
sub get_version_ids {
    my $self = shift;

=pod

=item B<checkout_vid> C<checkout_vid(vid, work_dir)>

Performs a lookup of C<vid> in the C<commit-db> followed by a checkout of
the corresponding revision with C<revision_id> to C<work_dir>.
The format of C<vid> is B<\d+[bf]>.

B<This method always performs a clean checkout, i.e., the working directory is
deleted before the checkout if it already exists>.

=pod

=item B<diff> C<diff(revision_id_1, revision_id_2 [, path])>

Returns the diff between C<revision_id_1> and C<revision_id_2> or C<undef> if
the diff failed. The C<path> argument is optional and can be used to compute a diff
between certain files or directories. Note that C<path> is relative to the root
of the working directory.

=item B<export_diff> C<export_diff(revision_id_1, revision_id_2, out_file [, path])>

Exports the diff between C<revision_id_1> and C<revision_id_2> to C<out_file>.
The path argument is optional and can be used to compute a diff between certain
files or directories. Note that C<path> is relative to the root of the working directory.

}

=pod

=item B<apply_patch> C<apply_patch(work_dir, patch_file [, path])>

Applies the patch provided in C<patch_file> to the working directory
C<work_dir>.  The path argument is optional and used as prefix for the files
to be patched. Note that C<path> is relative to the root of the working directory.

=cut

    @_ >= 3 or die $ARG_ERROR;
    my ($self, $work_dir, $patch_file, $path) = @_;

=head2 Provide new Vcs implementation

The provided default implementations may be overriden to provide specific behavior.
In most cases it is sufficient to override the following abstract methods to provide a vcs-specific cmd:

=over 4

=item B<_checkout_cmd(revision_id, work_dir)>

      Returns the cmd to checkout C<revision_id> to the working directory C<work_dir>

=cut
sub _checkout_cmd { die $ABSTRACT_METHOD; }
=pod

=item B<_apply_cmd(work_dir, patch_file [, path])>

      Returns the cmd to apply the patch in file C<patch_file> to the working
      directory C<work_dir>. The optional path C<path> is relative to the
      working directory and used to apply patches to certain files or directories.

=cut
sub _apply_cmd { die $ABSTRACT_METHOD; }
=pod

=item B<_diff_cmd(rev1, rev2, path)>

      Returns the cmd to compute a diff between two revisions C<rev1> and C<rev2>.
      The optional path C<path> is relative to the repository root and used to
      diff between certain files or directories.

=back

=cut
sub _diff_cmd { die $ABSTRACT_METHOD; }
sub _get_parent_revisions { die $ABSTRACT_METHOD; }

#
# Read commit-db and build cache
#
sub _build_db_cache {

    open (IN, "<$db") or die "Cannot open commit-db $db: $!";
    my $cache = {};
    while (<IN>) {
        chomp;
        /(\d+),([^,]+),([^,]+)/ or die "Corrupted commit-db!";
        $cache->{$1} = {b => $2, f => $3, line => $_};
    }
    close IN;

    return $cache;
}

#
# Truncate revision id to 8 characters if necessary
#
sub _trunc_rev_id {
    my $id = shift;
    if (length($id) > 8) {
        $id = substr($id, 0, 8);
    }
    return $id;
}
