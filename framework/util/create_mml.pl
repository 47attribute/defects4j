=head1 NAME

create_mml.pl -- create a Major-compatible MML file, which defines program mutations.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  create_mml.pl -p project_id -c classes_dir -o out_dir [-b bug_id]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generates an MML file for every bug id listed in F<classes_dir> -- for every bug id, a list
of classes that should be mutated has to be provided in a file with the following name:
F<C<bug_id>.src>.
The generated MML files are named F<C<bug_id>.mml> and written to F<out_dir>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -p C<project_id>

The id of the project for which the MML file is generated.
See L<Project|Project/"Available Project IDs"> module for available project IDs.

=item -b C<bug_id>

The bug id for which the MML file is generated (optional). Format: C<\d+>.

=item -c F<classes_dir>

The directory that contains the lists of classes that should be mutated.

=item -o F<out_dir>

The output directory to which the generated MML files are written.
